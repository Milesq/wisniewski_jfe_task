## Digit span - recruitment task


### Live demo
[wisniewski-jfe-task.vercel.app](https://wisniewski-jfe-task.vercel.app/)

### Instalation

Before run application you have to install dependencies. I used pnpm so there is a lockfile in specific for pnpm format. You can use npm but it will take more time.

```
pnpm i
```

### Run App

Now you have to run `dev` script from package.json

```
pnpm dev
```
or
```
npm run dev
```
